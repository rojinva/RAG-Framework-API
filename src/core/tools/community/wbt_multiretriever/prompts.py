------ Example Output ------
Response when the answer is found: 
The benefits of using passivation for High Aspect Ratio (HAR) Etch are detailed in the course objectives and descriptions provided in the sources. Here are the key benefits:
Improved Aspect Ratio Dependent Etching (ARDE): Passivation helps in managing the challenges associated with ARDE, which is crucial for achieving uniform etching profiles in high aspect ratio structures [1].
Enhanced Profile Control: Passivation techniques, such as Atomic Layer Passivation (ALP), provide better control over the etching profile, ensuring more precise and consistent results [1].
Reduction of Etch-Induced Damage: By using passivation, the etching process can be made less aggressive, thereby reducing the potential for damage to the etched structures. This is particularly important for maintaining the integrity of delicate features in HAR etching [1].
Improved Uniformity: Passivation layers can help in achieving more uniform etching across the wafer, which is essential for maintaining the quality and performance of the etched features [1].
Minimization of Defects: The use of passivation can help in minimizing defects such as micro-masking and sidewall roughness, which are common issues in HAR etching processes [1].Increased Throughput: By optimizing the etching process with passivation, it is possible to achieve higher throughput without compromising on the quality of the etch, leading to more efficient manufacturing processes [1].
These benefits make passivation a critical component in the etching process for high aspect ratio structures, ensuring better performance and reliability of the final product.

[3] Another problem is non-uniform sidewall passivation. Because of that, intra-cell loading cannot be minimized.\nIncumbent passivation method also tends to have variation between the ISO & dense area, where ISO area has more passivation. This will result in tapering at ISO feature.\nAnother limitation is substrate material dependent. The passivation deposits selectively on different materials. Thus causing profile distortion.\nLast but not least, conventional passivation method will result in CD loss on feature such as the FinFet. Si or SiGe will be consumed to form Silicon Oxide passivation.\nAs a result of all these limitations of incumbent passivation method, a new improve type of passivation is needed. The solution is Lam Aegis.\n1 6C O N F I D E N T I ALL AM R E S E AR CH\nLAM RESEARCH Confidential – Limited Access and Use\nConcept of Aegis03\nIn module 3, we will explain the concept of Aegis and a few examples of its benefits.

Benefits of ALD:\n1. Conformal coating independent of aspect ratio: Atomically flat & smooth.\n2. High quality film with precision thickness control: By number of ALD cycles.\n3. Non-selective deposition: Film growth independent of underlayer material/substrate.\n4. Minimum or no substrate material loss: Gas phase deposition will not consume substrate.\nLiquid Precursor Delivery\nGas Delivery\nWhat is Aegis ?\nAegis is an in-situ Atomic Layer Deposition system or ALD for Kiyo Conductor Etch chamber. The objective is to enable in-situ Atomic Layer Passivation or ALP in Kiyo F & G series process modules.\nPicture on the left shows a typical one cycle of ALD. It normally consists of 4 steps.\nIt starts with an adsorption step which the substrate is exposed with a precursor. This step is self limiting. Thus, only one atomic layer of precursor will be adhered to the substrate surface. Second step is “purge” where excessive precursor are pumped away.\nThird step is “activation” where the co-reactants are introduced to the precursor layer. This step is also self limiting where only just enough number of co-reactants will react with the layer of precursor. Last step is also “purge” where excessive co-reactants are pumped away.\nThe benefits of ALD are:\n1) Conformal coating which is independent of aspect ratio. The deposit layer is atomically flat & smooth.\n2) A high quality film with precise thickness control can be deposited by number of ALD cycles.\n3) It is a non-selective deposition where the film growth is independent of underlayer material or substrate. 4) It is a gas phase deposition which will not consume the substrate. There will be minimum or no substrate material loss. The image on the right shows the Aegis module which are attached to the left side of Kiyo 1 7C O N F I D E N T I ALL AM R E S E AR CH\nchamber.

Advantages over Thermal ALD:\n1. Allows lower substrate/chamber temperatures.\n2. Improved film properties due to more complete reaction.\n3. Reduced purge & nucleation time.\n4. Tunable stress/crystallinity with power.\nAegis ALP\nSoak-Dose Pump Out Oxidization Purge\n39 cycles on Ox\nIn this slide, we will explain the mechanism of Aegis Atomic Layer Passivation or ALP.\nLam uses BTBAS as the Aegis precursor. BTBAS is a well-established liquid ALD precursor. It is capable to deposit SiO2 with oxygen, Si3N4 with Nitrogen or Ammonia, and SiON with N2O.\nThe figure on the top right corner shows the Aegis ALP cycle. The ALP cycle starts with the “Soak-Dose” step where the Si precursor BTBAS is introduced to the Si surface. Adsorption will happen where an atomic layer of Si precursor gather on the Si surface. This step is self-limiting.\nThen it is followed by a pump out step where excessive precursors are pumped away.\nThe third step is another adsorption step where the O2 plasma is introduced. Self-limiting atomic layer of O2 reactants will gather on the Si precursor layer and starts to react to form SiO2. The step is then followed by a purge step that excessive O2 reactants are purged and pumped away.
Question: What is the basic layout and functionality of the Aegis LDS

------ Example Output ------
Response when the answer is found:
The Aegis Liquid Delivery System (LDS) is an integral part of the Kiyo Conductor Etch chamber, designed to enhance the etching process through in-situ Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD). Here is a detailed overview of its basic layout and functionality:
Basic Layout:
Location: The Aegis LDS is located on the left side of the Kiyo process module.
Components:
Liquid Flow Meter (LFM): Measures the flow rate of the liquid precursor.
Vaporizer: Converts the liquid precursor into vapor.
Helium Carrier Gas Mass Flow Controller (MFC): Controls the flow of helium, which acts as a carrier gas.
Valve Manifold Block: Directs the flow of gases and vaporized precursor to the process module.
EtherCAT PCB Control Board: Manages the control signals for the LDS components [1].
Functionality:
Liquid and Gas Delivery:
The liquid precursor is delivered from the sub-fab to the vaporizer, passing through the Liquid Flow Meter (LFM).
Helium or Argon acts as a carrier gas and is introduced at the vaporizer.
The mixture of vaporized precursor and carrier gas is then delivered to the manifold block and subsequently to the process module [1].
Operation:
Introduction of BTBAS: The liquid precursor (e.g., BTBAS) is delivered to the vaporizer, where it is converted into vapor. The vaporized precursor, along with the carrier gas, is then directed to the process module.
Flow Path Visualization: The flow path includes the LFM, vaporizer, and manifold block, ensuring precise control of the precursor and carrier gas flow into the process module [1].
User Interface (UI):
The Aegis UI is accessed via the "Maintain/Gas/Vac/Aegis" page.
Users can view the status of common interlocks (e.g., "Abatement Ready", "Scrubber sensor", "Leak Sensor").
Manual operation of Aegis valves and setup of LDS Carrier Gas and LDS Liquid flows can be performed.
Software macros such as Pump Down, LDS Only pump purge, Sleep, Wake, and Leak Back rates can be initiated from the UI [1].
Software Macros:
LDS Only Pump Purge: Performs a pump-and-purge routine on Aegis lines before maintenance work.
Sleep/Wake Routine: Puts Aegis into low power mode when not in use and returns it to operational state when needed.
Pump Down: Reduces the LDS Pressure Gauge Reading to baseline level [1].
Summary:
The Aegis LDS is a sophisticated system designed to deliver liquid precursors and carrier gases precisely to the Kiyo process module. It includes several key components such as the Liquid Flow Meter, Vaporizer, and Valve Manifold Block, all controlled via an EtherCAT PCB control board. The system's functionality is managed through a user-friendly interface that allows for monitoring and manual operation of the LDS components, ensuring optimal performance during the etching process.
