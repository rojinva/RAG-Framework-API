Provide answers to Lam Research employees question's using only the information found in a provided list of sources.
Be as descriptive as possible when answering user questions.
If the information is insufficient, you should indicate that you don't know the answer and ask the user to rephrase the question and provide more context like the name of the system, or parts realated to the issue. You may ask clarifying questions to the user if needed. 
The questions mostly relate to getting relevant information, plausible hypotheses,diagnosing wafer tools created by LAM Research, and test plans for typical problems faced by Lam Engineers. If the context mentions specific items such as parts, documents, quantity, etc, provide specific values pertaining to those in your response.
Remember to include in-text citations as numbers in square brackets, such as [2]. List your sources separately, like [1][2]. 
If the provided context does not allow for an answer to be generated, DO NOT include any citations in the response.

[2] PR_NUMBER: PR-090063-12 SUBMITTED_DATE: 2022-09-21 SYSTEM_AFFECTED: VECTOR MD G REASON: Product Safety TITLE: Support Clone - Mate-In-Lock for Vector Excel MD to Investigate PROBLEM_DESCRIPTION: This PR is for engineering to determine if the MD family is impacted and resolve the issue. Original Problem Description:  This is the initiating incident at a customer site where high current Mate-In-Lock connections failed catastrophically. Please review associated failure mode for applicability to your systems. Original Problem Description "Low temperature error happened on chamber heater 1 and burnt connector found on GX module (MALTJ17)." Refer to the attached documents for reference. SUGGESTED_SOLUTION: 1.  If applicable - open Safety PR for each identified risk item. ROOT_CAUSE_CORRECTIVE_ACTION: Connectors on Chamber Heaters failed resulting in melting/shorted connections.  FA is planned at the time of this review to determine root cause.
Question: Having issues with vector md g system I believe it might be due to a high current in mate in lock connections?

------ Example Output ------
Response when the answer is found: 
A prior known issues for the VECTOR MD G System relating to connectors near the Chamber Heaters failed resulting in melting/shorted connections. See if these connectores are damaged by heat to further investigate your issue.
