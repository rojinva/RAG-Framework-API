Sticking coefficient is defined as the ratio of the number of atoms/molecules that adsorb, or \"stick\", to a surface to the total number of atoms/molecules that impinge upon that surface during the same period of time.

For example, during the Single Trench Isolation or STI etch, the incoming CD varies due to a phenomenon calls “Pitch Walking”. This phenomenon is caused by the photolithography limitation of Self Align Double or Multiple patterning.\nThe “Pitch Walking” will cause the STI features aspect ratio to vary. As a result of different aspect ratio, after etch, the intra-cell depth loading is observed.\nThe image in the center explains how the ARDE causing the intra-cell depth loading.\nThe vertical etch rate of each feature is limited by how much the reactant fluxes reaching the bottom of each feature, which are sensitive to the aspect ratio. In simultaneous etch process, the process regions are not decoupled or independent of each other. As a result, it is very difficult to eliminate the depth loading or reducing it without any undesirable side effect.\nImage on the right explains how the “Phase” processing utilizing the Kiyo Mixed Mode Pulsing or MMP to minimize the intra-cell depth loading.\nThe idea is to decouple each process region such as passivation, surface activation and etch. By using the sidewall passivation, the etch rate is limited by surface activation. This precise layer-by-layer etch, conceptually is independent of aspect ratio. As you can see, a precise uniform of passivation is critical. 1 4C O N F I D E N T I ALL AM R E S E AR CH\nLAM RESEARCH Confidential – Limited Access and Use\nBT/Pre-clean\nClear etch byproduct\n▪ Slightly deeper depths after removing byproduct deposition without mask or CD loss.

Clogging forms when too much passivation at the top of the feature and causing an etch stop.\nBow CD shift is another problem with existing profile control passivation. It is a result from the uncontrolled or variation of the location of passivation.\nAnother problem is non-uniform sidewall passivation. Because of that, intra-cell loading cannot be minimized.\nIncumbent passivation method also tends to have variation between the ISO & dense area, where ISO area has more passivation. This will result in tapering at ISO feature.\nAnother limitation is substrate material dependent. The passivation deposits selectively on different materials. Thus causing profile distortion.\nLast but not least, conventional passivation method will result in CD loss on feature such as the FinFet. Si or SiGe will be consumed to form Silicon Oxide passivation.\nAs a result of all these limitations of incumbent passivation method, a new improve type of passivation is needed. The solution is Lam Aegis.\n1 6C O N F I D E N T I ALL AM R E S E AR CH
Question: What are the benefits of using passivation for HAR Etch?

------ Example Output ------
Response when the answer is found: 
The benefits of using passivation for High Aspect Ratio (HAR) Etch are multifaceted and address several challenges associated with etching deep features. Here are the key benefits:
Top CD Control: Passivation helps control the critical dimension (CD) at the top of the feature. Without passivation, the top CD tends to broaden as the etch depth increases due to Aspect Ratio Dependent Etching (ARDE). By applying the right amount of passivation at the right location and time, the top CD blow-up can be minimized, ensuring better dimensional control [1].
Reduction of Intra-cell Depth Loading: Passivation reduces intra-cell depth loading, which is the variation in etch depth within a cell due to different aspect ratios. By decoupling the process regions (passivation, surface activation, and etch), passivation ensures a more uniform etch depth across different features, minimizing depth loading issues [1].
Improved Mask Selectivity: Passivation enhances mask selectivity by protecting the mask during the etch process. This is particularly important in steps like the breakthrough or pre-clean step, where passivation helps remove etch byproducts without causing mask or CD loss. This results in deeper etch depths with minimal CD change and mask loss [1].
Profile Control: Passivation helps in maintaining the profile of the etched features. It prevents issues like bowing and necking by ensuring that the sidewalls are adequately protected during the etch process. This leads to straighter profiles and better overall feature integrity [1].
Aspect Ratio Independent Passivation (ARIP): Passivation techniques like Atomic Layer Passivation (ALP) provide aspect ratio-independent passivation, ensuring uniform passivation thickness across features with varying aspect ratios. This helps in maintaining consistent etch rates and profiles regardless of the feature dimensions [1].
Reduction of CD Loss: Passivation can prevent critical dimension (CD) loss, especially in features like FinFETs. By using oxide passivation, for example, the CD loss that typically occurs with conventional O2 flash processes can be significantly reduced [1].
In summary, passivation in HAR etch processes offers significant benefits in terms of CD control, depth loading reduction, mask selectivity, profile control, and prevention of CD loss, making it a crucial technique for achieving high-quality etch results in semiconductor manufacturing.

Benefits of ALD:\n1. Conformal coating independent of aspect ratio: Atomically flat & smooth.\n2. High quality film with precision thickness control: By number of ALD cycles.\n3.

The objective is to enable in-situ Atomic Layer Passivation or ALP in Kiyo F & G series process modules.\nPicture on the left shows a typical one cycle of ALD. It normally consists of 4 steps.\nIt starts with an adsorption step which the substrate is exposed with a precursor. This step is self limiting. Thus, only one atomic layer of precursor will be adhered to the substrate surface. Second step is “purge” where excessive precursor are pumped away.\nThird step is “activation” where the co-reactants are introduced to the precursor layer. This step is also self limiting where only just enough number of co-reactants will react with the layer of precursor. Last step is also “purge” where excessive co-reactants are pumped away.\nThe benefits of ALD are:\n1) Conformal coating which is independent of aspect ratio. The deposit layer is atomically flat & smooth.\n2) A high quality film with precise thickness control can be deposited by number of ALD cycles.\n3) It is a non-selective deposition where the film growth is independent of underlayer material or substrate. 4) It is a gas phase deposition which will not consume the substrate. There will be minimum or no substrate material loss. The image on the right shows the Aegis module which are attached to the left side of Kiyo 1 7C O N F I D E N T I ALL AM R E S E AR CH\nchamber.

The ALP cycle starts with the “Soak-Dose” step where the Si precursor BTBAS is introduced to the Si surface. Adsorption will happen where an atomic layer of Si precursor gather on the Si surface. This step is self-limiting.\nThen it is followed by a pump out step where excessive precursors are pumped away.\nThe third step is another adsorption step where the O2 plasma is introduced. Self-limiting atomic layer of O2 reactants will gather on the Si precursor layer and starts to react to form SiO2. The step is then followed by a purge step that excessive O2 reactants are purged and pumped away.
Question: What is the basic layout and functionality of the Aegis LDS

------ Example Output ------
Response when the answer is found:
The Aegis Liquid Delivery System (LDS) is an integral part of the Kiyo Conductor Etch chamber, designed to enhance the etching process through in-situ Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD). Here is a detailed overview of its basic layout and functionality:
Basic Layout:
Location: The Aegis LDS is located on the left side of the Kiyo process module.
Components:
Liquid Flow Meter (LFM): Measures the flow rate of the liquid precursor.
Vaporizer: Converts the liquid precursor into vapor.
Helium Carrier Gas Mass Flow Controller (MFC): Controls the flow of helium, which acts as a carrier gas.
Valve Manifold Block: Directs the flow of gases and vaporized precursor to the process module.
EtherCAT PCB Control Board: Manages the control signals for the LDS components [1].
Functionality:
Liquid and Gas Delivery:
The liquid precursor is delivered from the sub-fab to the vaporizer, passing through the Liquid Flow Meter (LFM).
Helium or Argon acts as a carrier gas and is introduced at the vaporizer.
The mixture of vaporized precursor and carrier gas is then delivered to the manifold block and subsequently to the process module [1].
Operation:
Introduction of BTBAS: The liquid precursor (e.g., BTBAS) is delivered to the vaporizer, where it is converted into vapor. The vaporized precursor, along with the carrier gas, is then directed to the process module.
Flow Path Visualization: The flow path includes the LFM, vaporizer, and manifold block, ensuring precise control of the precursor and carrier gas flow into the process module [1].
User Interface (UI):
The Aegis UI is accessed via the "Maintain/Gas/Vac/Aegis" page.
Users can view the status of common interlocks (e.g., "Abatement Ready", "Scrubber sensor", "Leak Sensor").
Manual operation of Aegis valves and setup of LDS Carrier Gas and LDS Liquid flows can be performed.
Software macros such as Pump Down, LDS Only pump purge, Sleep, Wake, and Leak Back rates can be initiated from the UI [1].
Software Macros:
LDS Only Pump Purge: Performs a pump-and-purge routine on Aegis lines before maintenance work.
Sleep/Wake Routine: Puts Aegis into low power mode when not in use and returns it to operational state when needed.
Pump Down: Reduces the LDS Pressure Gauge Reading to baseline level [1].
Summary:
The Aegis LDS is a sophisticated system designed to deliver liquid precursors and carrier gases precisely to the Kiyo process module. It includes several key components such as the Liquid Flow Meter, Vaporizer, and Valve Manifold Block, all controlled via an EtherCAT PCB control board. The system's functionality is managed through a user-friendly interface that allows for monitoring and manual operation of the LDS components, ensuring optimal performance during the etching process.
